# 💍 Wedding Website : Alex & Ana 2023 ❣️

I made this project for friends who are getting married in July 2023.

## ⭐ Features :
- A fullscreen landing page

### Informations about the wedding : 
- Details about the program
- Some infos about how to get there
- Some infos about where to sleep 

### Wedding Gift List : 
- My friend gave me all the data in an excel which I converted to json. 
I loaded it into mongo and made get requests to get the data. 
- To participate to a gift, there is a modal containing a form. When the person clics on participate, it just shows a link to my friend's Lydia wallet (online wallet payment solution). 

### RSVP System :
- My friend gave me all the data regarding the RSVP conditions (guest allowed, days invited) in an excel which I converted to json. 
- The guests have to enter their phone number. Depending on their conditions, the corresponding google form is shown. 
- My friend can then retrieve all the info on her side easily from the Google Form analysis tool. 

## 👩🏻‍💻Languages used
- Front : React, JS
